Supercharge your WordPress blocks. Accelerate increases your sites engagement by extending WordPress blocks with marketing and AI capabilities.

== Description ==

**Drive higher engagement with your content today**. Altis Accelerate seamlessly integrates and extends the Block Editor to give you unparalleled access to the next generation of marketing technologies. We provide all these tools on top of Synced Patterns.

While Altis is still in beta, we have released the following features.

### Features:
- **Synced Blocks**, we extend synced patterns to bring them to the front of your editing experience.
- **AI-Powered Content**, quickly create content and layout using our AI backend (free, no OpenAI key required)
- **Native Block-Level Analytics**, our in-house analytics solution built specifically for blocks — clickthroughs, conversions are tracked by us and owned by you (with a maximum 90-day retention).
- **A/B Testing Blocks**, create multiple variants within a block and compare their performance.
- **Personalization Blocks**, create variants for different audiences within a block.
- **Broadcast Blocks**, quickly advertise and promote blocks throughout your site. Once you add a Broadcast Block via editor or in the template code, you can add as many reusable blocks to its rotation as you want, also receiving impression insights.
- **Content Explorer**, a new way to view your sites content and performance, including seeing all your reusable blocks in one place. Finally a dashboard made for marketers.

All of these use our native analytics backbone which complies with GDPR (see below)

**Important:** In order to use Altis Accelerate, you'll need to register for an account. If you don't already have one, you can create one as part of the plugin installation process. This is required for our backend AI and analytics services.
